# AudioEye Take-Home Challenge
## Where to start

Follow the [instructions document](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) provided.
Design Documentation here [design doc](./DESIGN_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Feedback

- Time taken: 4 hrs +- 15 minutes ( couldn't help myself trying to spruce up the pokemon cards. )
- Loved this takehome! Great chance to show a little creativity. I feel like I had the chance to show off some front-end skills in the 4 hour alotted time. 
- Wasn't sure if the first step of the instructions wanted a fully-fledged alternate app that acted as a server to which the service would make requests to, or if simple parsing of the json document was enough. In the interest of time I went with the latter but would have created a "server" app if I had the time.

## Other notes && considerations

- To remove a card from your deck, simply click on it again. It should be removed.
- Cards should be tabbable, and hitting either `Space` or `Enter` should function just like clicking a card. This is to ensure full keyboard accessibility. 
- The app and components should scale well to mobile screens, although more can be done here to improve the experience.

## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm ci`

Installs the dependencies required for the app

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
